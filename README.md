# Vehicle-Detection

# The goals of this project are the following:
1.  Create and train a deep learning model to classify if patch image is either a car or non-car.
2.  Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
3. Run pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
4.  Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
